# üáÆüá≥ Goa and The Stuff

My friend, ‚ÄúM‚Äù one day in 2016, did the craziest thing ever. He sold his house,
his Ford F350 and all his belongings and quit his job and relocated his entire
life to India, specifically; Goa.

He loved Goa so much, but love is cruel. One day he got mixed up with some shady
group regarding drugs and ended up in jail. Just a few months ago he got out and
you‚Äôd think he‚Äôll fly back to Jordan immediately, but no, he‚Äôs still there
living his life and loving every minute.

Beautiful things are always dangerous. And in case you visit Goa one day and
wish to play it safe but also smoke some dope! Here‚Äôs a little guide for you:

Well, as beautiful as Goan beaches are, I wouldn't tell you to go smoke weed on
any beach at all. Beaches in the North are always buzzing with people so places
like Baga, Calangute, Candolim or Miramar are a big no-no. You never know who's
coming after you.

Anjuna and Vagator are relatively relaxed so you could easily sit in Curlies'
and see the waves come and go while you smoke that blunt. Morjim is yet another
beautiful beach and somehow doesn't stay crowded. From my personal experience,
an early-morning session at Morjim would be no less than magical.

However, I must warn you about the consequences. Goan police is really strict
about drugs and especially when it's with tourists so you better keep your eyes
open while you're smoking. If you're not a regular smoker and don't have a lot
of experience smoking in public places, take extra care.

Also, I'm assuming if you're traveling to Goa, you would spend most part of your
trip in the North but beaches in the South are far more secluded and cleaner so
you might want to make that extra effort in your pursuit of trying to be one
with nature.

You are a noob in Goa, or even a noob to ‚Äòstuff‚Äô normally (and just wish to
smoke up in Goa to own a time of your life), here are some general
recommendations on where to find your stuff cc: Goa.

The Capris/Cigarette Shops: the most effective and most reliable leads may be
found at your nearest Paanwala if he doesn't keep the things with himself. The
likelihood is he‚Äôll have some to sell it to you, but if he doesn‚Äôt he will
direct you to the closest peddler.

You'll completely trust your Paanwala for this information; they never lie
regarding anything because they need their cuts sorted.

The Internet Cafes/Money-Exchange Shops: This culture is exclusively credited to
Goa alone, where the peddlers operate right out of those internet cafes. They'll
obviously not provide you with the things right then & there, but 99 out of 100
times, they might have what you wish.

And there's actually a logic behind it ‚Äì since all the firangs (read: Russians)
are certain to visit the money-exchange shops once they land in Goa, these shop
owners became stuff-operators in due course time taking their cuts for every
sale. Whether you reside in Palolem, Arambol, Baga, or Calangute, these shops
are everywhere and now you recognize why.

The restaurant waiters: Although it's going to sound outrageous initially, it's
completely safe to ask any restaurant waiter where you'll get your ‚Äúquote‚Äù. Just
confirm that the waiter is comparatively young to stay in the safer side.
they're another species within the state that thrives on the ‚Äòmiddleman's
commission‚Äô for the things.

The bike/car/scooter lenders: These are probably the primary guys you‚Äôd attend
see after checking during a hotel or a shack because you simply can‚Äôt do without
an Activa in Goa. It's absolutely safe to ask them for the whereabouts of stuff.

The shack owners: If you're staying or dining in an exceeding shack on a Goa
beach, it's extremely easy to seek out the great stuff. Just enquire the person
sitting at the counter. He may or might not be directly involved but 7 out of 10
times he would direct you to the one that may have the data on what you would
like. But only ask if the owner‚Äôs an Indian, never ask from a firing owner.
