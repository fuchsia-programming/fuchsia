# üßò Activism

This article is about politics (to those not interested in USA politics, sorry,
this will be especially boring), but more importantly, it is about discovering
the TRUTH. Today, in 2021, there are so many lies printed and published on the
web that discovering the truth can be very difficult. Several years ago, I THINK
in about 2014 and definitely before D. Trump declared his candidacy, I did a
search on the web that led me to a very interesting article.

I cannot remember the exact terms I used in my search, but the question was
generally phrased like this: What policies do present day Democrats share with
the Eisenhower administration? I used both Bing and Google and the same result
was first on Bing and second in the Google results. It was an article on the
Daily Kos website that unfortunately, I can no longer find. Regardless, history
has recorded the truth!

The article explained that the Eisenhower administration advocated and
implemented policies such as Unemployment Insurance and other ‚Äúsocial policies‚Äù
which are similar to current policies advocated by Democrats. Also, tax rates
for the wealthy and for corporations were at the highest levels ever seen in the
USA. Infrastructure spending was also a huge part of Eisenhower‚Äôs agenda.

Here‚Äôs how that all worked. Corporations and wealthy citizens contributed huge
amounts to the Federal budget coffers. The government was in turn able to
support less fortunate citizens, so that they were able to buy necessities and
even had some left over for discretionary spending. The spending on
infrastructure projects created many jobs of course and those newly employed
people spent their money and paid their taxes as well. The less fortunate among
us, those at least partially supported by the ‚Äúsocial policies‚Äù were able to buy
products and services from businesses, many of which were wealthy corporations
which were paying those high taxes.

One result of all this was that corporations realized that they had customers to
buy their products and services, so rather than keeping the money they would
have saved on tax breaks, as corporations do now, they invested in equipment
(which had to be produced by other businesses) and supplies, and they hired
tremendous numbers of people to help provide the products and services that they
KNEW they could sell. Of course this all snowballed. They hired workers who then
had jobs and could buy even more products and services. The businesses that
supplied machinery, and materials to the corporations hired and invested too.

I hope you can see where this is all leading. The Eisenhower era enjoyed perhaps
the most tremendous growth rate and prosperity of any time in the history of the
USA. Corporations gladly paid the high taxes because THEY were growing and
prospering.

Today, members of the same political party that supported those policies
implemented by - the Eisenhower administration, say ‚ÄúOh no, that will never
work! We need tax breaks for the poor corporations and wealthy people!‚Äù WHAT? It
strikes me that I have discovered THE TRUTH here. Giving huge tax breaks to
large corporations and the rich is not working. Those corporations and people do
nothing but just keep the money they are saving. If the social programs are not
supported, our less fortunate citizens, the ones criticized as lazy and
worthless, do not have money to spend, so why would the big businesses hire
anyone, or produce more goods or services? The polices NOW advocated by
Republicans are not working and the policies supported by Democrats are the ones
that the Eisenhower administration PROVED WILL WORK.

No, Democrats are not always right and Republicans are not always wrong, but as
an ACTIVIST, I MUST speak the TRUTH and THAT is something we ALL need to keep in
mind and LOOK FOR.
