# ðŸŽ¶ Ambient

"Aether sounds, rippling wave movements, mysterious, distant greenish-blue
lights, breath-taking, almost indescribable moods. It's like walking the
highways of a fairy-tale empire, away from the monotony of everyday life, while
techno pounding in the adjoining hall. "

One of the UKâ€™s best-known musical figures in the field is Mixmaster Morris
(â€˜Irrestistible Forceâ€™). Around the 80s, it usually appeared in chill out rooms
as well, because no matter what hectic genre we are talking about, there will
always be a point where one can relax a bit from the fatigue so far so that
later one can throw oneself into the party resume with renewed vigor.

The recurring sounds in these music are the sounds of nature as well as the
acoustic instruments (like the piano, violin, or just the flute) whose sound are
modulated with different effects.

"The genre originated in the 1960s and 1970s, when new musical instruments were
being introduced to a wider market, such as the synthesizer. It was presaged by
Erik Satie's furniture music and styles such as musique concrÃ¨te, minimal music,
Jamaican dub music and German electronic music, but was prominently named and
popularized by British musician Brian Eno\* in 1978 with his album Ambient 1:
Music for Airports; Eno opined that ambient music "must be as ignorable as it is
interesting."

The name Future Sound of London may be familiar from the fact that they made the
ambient music really famous with the album "Lifeforms" (1994).

The genre has become known around the world, including Ibiza, where the name of
Jose Padilla (â€˜CafÃ© del Marâ€™), can be associated with ambient music.

"Then the ambient died in its beauty. The experimental spirits enriched other
trends, especially trip hop with hitherto unknown colors, perhaps they
themselves created a new style, as New York's SD Spooky did with illbient. In
England, there were only three ambient disc jockeys in the late 1990s: Mixmaster
Morris, Patterson and Andrea Parker. Among the publishers, EM stood in the mud
for a long time."
