# ü™ñ Australian Army

The largest country in Oceania and the world‚Äôs 6th largest country in total
area.

With 26 million Aussie living the best life having cheeky barbies in the arvo
and sharing a cold bevvie with the mates!

But, don‚Äôt let the friendly people of Australia fool you, they are locked and
loaded!

As many nations have emerged as a result of colonialism, Australia, the country
that has never lost a war, has shared its fair share of conflicts in its
history. One might ask; how strong of an army Australia has since it‚Äôs right
there with Canada holding a record of zero losses at wars!

Let‚Äôs find out!

The Australian army is ranked #19 out of 140 countries according to
globalfirepower.com, and the 12th biggest spender on military defense budget in
the world, with some military media stating that the country intends to become a
‚ÄúLethal Military Force‚Äù, you can expect it to climb above in the spending budget
to exceed the 12th rank position!

Much of the money spent goes to the navy which is not surprising given the
country‚Äôs geographical location, which shows on the map that Australia as a
country is an island.

It has also joined in the spending frenzy on the aforementioned F-35 joint
strike fighters, which honestly is really cool.

With 61,000 active personnel and 21,000 in reserve, it could do better since
there are over 10 million available manpower and 280,661 Blokes and Sheilas
reaching military age annually.

Now let‚Äôs talk about equipment, I know you‚Äôve been waiting for this!

With 59 tanks, 2040 armored fighting vehicles, and 75 towed artillery, don‚Äôt let
the 59 tanks fool ya, they are really good tanks! They were highly rated leopard
ones, but they have been replaced with M-1 Abrams.

Where the United States exceed all the planet with their air force power, the
Aussies are doing pretty well in this field, the country has a total of 465
aircraft, just over 150 of which are fighter and attack aircraft, it also has a
small fleet of F/A-18F super hornets and F/A-18A and B hornets as well as EA-18G
growlers.

As for the navy, Australia has 47 ships and is one of few nations to own
aircraft carriers, the Aussies also own 11 frigates, 6 submarines, 13 patrol
crafts, and 6 mine warfare ships.

As for owning nuclear weapons, Australia doesn‚Äôt seem interested in developing
them, it does, however, have aircraft that could deliver them.

In conclusion:

Australia's armed forces‚Äîthe Australian Defense Force (ADF) ‚Äî comprise the Royal
Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army, and the Royal Australian Air Force
(RAAF). The titular role of Commander-in-Chief is vested in the
Governor-General, who appoints a Chief of the Defense Force from one of the
armed services on the advice of the government.

In a diarchy, the CDF serves as co-chairman of the Defense Committee, conjointly
with the Secretary of Defense, in the command and control of the Australian
Defense Organization.

Australia has been involved in United Nations and regional peacekeeping,
disaster relief, and armed conflict, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq;
Australia currently has deployed about 2,241 personnel in varying capacities to
12 international operations in areas including Iraq and Afghanistan.
