# Brisbane

Right this moment while you’re just checking out the title of this article and wonder what is it about, I’ll take you all over the beautiful modern city of Brisbane in Australia!
This specific city holds a great deal to me since my friend John is from there, and he’s officially my favorite Australian friend and can’t say that will be easy to beat!

A modern, high built and filled with many stuff that you can do, the capital of the state of Queensland, Brisbane, is located in land from Moreton Bay between the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast.

Queensland is Australia's Sunshine State and enjoys a subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and warm, sunny winters. In Brisbane, any time of year is a good time for adventurous outdoor activities along the river or coast. Experience the more relaxing side of Brisbane in the parklands, museums and bars.

"Brissie" still has the laid-back country feel that is so iconic for the land Down Under. However, it is Australia's third-largest city, houses over two million people, and is growing fast.

Start your tour of the city on Brisbane's biggest hill. Mount Coot-tha and while you are here, explore the wonders of the Southern Hemisphere in the Planetarium and Brisbane Botanical Gardens... including the laughing kookaburra.
Feed lorikeets and see iconic Australian wildlife at the nearby Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. Meet kangaroos, koalas and wombats and don't miss the animal shows, which demonstrate some real Aussie traditions!

Down river, in the central business district, the Queen Street Mall displays all the country's big retail brands. Visit the nearby Brisbane Museum to learn about the mining boom and other events that shaped this city. Exhibits show how World Expo '88 led to the transformation of the river's southern bank, the city's favorite backyard, which even has its own beach!

Spacious South Bank has many free activities and facilities which attract more than 10 million people every year.
Cool off in a lagoon or browse the weekend markets. Join the locals for a beer, or visit one of the many prominent museums and theaters.

The Wheel of Brisbane overlooks the Cultural Forecourt, a collection of Queensland's major museums and theaters. Meet some prehistoric creatures, admire indigenous and European modern art or see a show at the Performing Arts Center. From the piers at South Bank, take the public ferry downstream to Newfarm Park, where the restored Powerhouse has become a real institution among art and music lovers.

On your way back, hop off at Kangaroo point to climb the Story Bridge: One of the best spots to watch the sun set over the city. Book your guided tour for midafternoon, because nightfall comes early in Queensland.

Get an early start and jump on the ferry to Moreton Island for a fun day out on the beach. Join a Segway tour along the shore before surfing down a massive sand dune. On a hot day, snorkel around the Tangalooma wrecks, or if you rather stay high and dry, book a helicopter ride instead. Flying over the bay and the Coral Sea, it is clear that Queensland's natural beauty merely starts in Brisbane.

I myself am a whisky and jazz bar kind of guy so I’d be so happy with places like Cobbler and Gresham.

In 2015, a competition by travel guidebook Rough Guides saw Brisbane elected as one of the top ten most beautiful cities in the world, citing reasons such as "its winning combination of high-rise modern architecture, lush green spaces and the enormous Brisbane River that snakes its way through the center before emptying itself into the azure Moreton Bay".

In 2019 it was named by travel insurance site InsureMyTrip as one of the world's top three cities to visit as a senior citizen. And I bet it still is!
