# üè° Chino Valley

As in the state of Arizona in general, the Town of Chino Valley is also diverse,
but I would say that Chino Valley‚Äôs politics lean quite heavily toward the
Right, the more conservative side of the political spectrum. I have no reference
for this assertion other than the fact that I have lived in Chino Valley since
2006 and I DO pay attention to these things. I also feel that the subject of
politics might be more important in this case simply because it does seem to
affect our lives here more than in some other locations.

Before I proceed with examples of my assertion, I should note that among the
many acquaintances I have made here in CV, the overwhelming majority of them,
including the conservatives, are very friendly and kind people.

Even though it has been six months since our nation elected Joe Biden as
President, I still see the occasional truck or car with a big Trump/Pence flag
or sticker and just last week I noticed a neighbor finally took down his huge
Trump/Pence sign from the front of his house.

The Town Council seems to make its decisions based on normal American Republican
Party preferences, favoring big businesses and those with money, rather than
those who actually work for a living. A case in point is a recent decision to
allow development of new homes surrounding the park in the very center of our
subdivision, even though that is contrary to the stated goals of the Town
(maintenance of Open Space), common sense safety concerns, and also contrary to
the plan of the subdivision as stated when most of us purchased our homes some
years ago.

I see other signs of conservatism whenever I am out and about in town. It is not
unusual to see a person carrying a weapon openly when I‚Äôm shopping. Guns are
often worn and so are large knives. I simply do not understand why one would
feel the need to be openly armed when shopping. That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm NOT a
conservative. I also see MOST local citizens carrying out their business without
wearing a mask to prevent their infection or them spreading COVID- 19. More
conservatives scorn this preventative tool than do liberals. Bumper stickers
supporting conservative views in subtle and very ‚Äúin your face‚Äù language are
common. I consider myself to be a little bit courageous by displaying my ‚ÄúProud
Democrat‚Äù bumper sticker.

Why am I taking up so much space discussing local politics? It‚Äôs simply because
it seems to be so important to so many of my fellow local citizens. I believe
that many of them are fearful that they are in danger of losing the ‚ÄúAmerican
way of life‚Äù, and to me, that is a sad thing. I also find it sad that THEY are
making ME afraid that THEY cannot accept something so simple and American as a
change of leadership due to the results of an election. OK, that‚Äôs it. I said
what I had to say. My Democrat neighbors and I know who we are and we DO
peacefully coexist with our Republican neighbors.

What do I like about Chino Valley? Pretty much everything else. Most people here
are very thoughtful and considerate of each other. The views are beautiful. We
have mountains to the east and to the west. About 80 miles away to the
Northeast, are the San Francisco Peaks. One of the three pinnacles is Humphreys
Peak, the tallest mountain in Arizona. ‚ÄúThe Peaks‚Äù are visible from CV on most
days, sometimes snowcapped. The weather is generally moderate and almost always
easily tolerated. We have very little obvious pollution. We have most of the
services, supplies and restaurants/bars that we need and when we do need to
travel, many more choices are only about 20 miles away. We have only one
supermarket though. We COULD use a little competition to keep prices down.

The ambiance in Chino Valley is decidedly ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù (USA jargon implying ‚Äúcowboy
style‚Äù). That‚Äôs fine with me. From the time I was about eight years old, until I
was almost 60, I lived in Colorado, the majority of that time in the mountains,
NOT in a city. My first job was working in a stables, guiding tourists around
the surrounding mountains on horseback and tending to the horses. So, I usually
feel quite comfortable in my Arizona home.

Much of the wildlife I mentioned in my article on Arizona, can be found within
the town limits of Chino Valley. We literally have cattle pastures to the right
and the left within walking distance of our house. We often walk our dog there
(we walk every morning) and that is where I have seen Coyotes, endangered
Mexican Gray Wolves, Pronghorn Antelope, and also snakes and tarantulas,
MMWWAAHAHAHA.‚Ä¶ Pronghorns are ‚Äúthe fastest land animal in North America‚Äù and
watching them run is fascinating. They run effortlessly for long distances.

To wrap it all up, living in Chino Valley is like living in a town, just barely,
and like ALMOST living in the wild. We REALLY enjoy that.
