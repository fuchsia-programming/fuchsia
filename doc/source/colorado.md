# üá∫üá∏ Colorado

Best known for its wonderful and diverse scenery, encompassing most of the
southern Rocky Mountains in the U.S.A., Colorado is simply put, colorful. The
word ‚ÄúColorado‚Äù is derived from the Spanish word for ‚Äúcolored red‚Äù. For many
years Colorado vehicle license plates said ‚ÄúColorful Colorado‚Äù. A little more
than half the state in the west, is occupied by the Rocky Mountains and the
‚Äúfront range‚Äù, and the western edge of the Great Plains in eastern Colorado
contain vast farm and ranch lands. We can‚Äôt ignore the fact that there are also
deserts with huge sand dunes, high plains, deep canyons, deciduous forests and
buttes to delight in.

The state has been a territory of the U.S. Since 1861 (after multiple disputes
over a period of years, involving Spain, France, Mexico, the U.S., and other
interests), and in 1876 President U.S. Grant signed the proclamation admitting
Colorado to the Union as the 38th state. It is nicknamed The Centennial State,
commemorating 100 years since the signing of the United States Declaration of
Independence. The area has been inhabited by Native Americans for over 13,000
years. The 2020 United States Census listed the population as 5,773,714 people
engaged in a wide array of activities such as agriculture, ranching, mining,
forestry, manufacturing, government and defense, and tourism. Unfortunately,
Climate Change is having an adverse affect on some of these activities. It is
just slightly southwest of the center of the U.S.

The metropolitan area of the capital, Denver, known as ‚Äúthe Mile High City‚Äù,
just east of the front range, contains about 85% of the population of the state.
It was built very near sites of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indian tribes‚Äô
seasonal encampments. The Ute Indians to the south also (as one might expect)
suffered at the hands of those looking for wealth in Colorado. The infamous Sand
Creek Massacre occurred in 1864 about 170 miles S.E. of Denver where the
murdering militia was based. Mining was one of the drivers of early Denver
history as well as other usual frontier town activities such as gambling,
saloons, livestock trading, agriculture, and other commercial activities to
support a large population. Denver also aspired to become a transportation hub.
On June 24, 1870 the citizens cheered the completion of the Denver Pacific
Railroad link to the first transcontinental railroad of the U.S.A. routed
through Cheyenne Wyoming. Denver was finally linked to the rest of the nation
and this was the beginning of a period of economic prosperity (and notoriety, as
explained in my referenced Wikipedia articles). As such, Denver and Colorado
attracted a wide variety of ethnic immigrants and people moving to the area with
quite different ambitions: military, some religious, and some predatory. Denver
is now a very cosmopolitan city (not a complement or a criticism, just a fact).

One especially good thing happened in Colorado on November 7, 1893. Colorado
became the second state to grant universal suffrage to women, and the first to
do so by majority vote of the men of the state. Colorado was the first western
state to host a large political convention- when the Democrats held their
convention in Denver in 1908. The Great Depression was very hard on Colorado,
but following World War II a major immigration wave helped to stimulate the
tourism industry and high technology became an important part of the state‚Äôs
economy. This author benefited from the technology stimulus when working at
several small electronics firms and at Ball Aerospace in Boulder (six years)
from approximately 1978 to 1992.

Another notable aspect of Colorado‚Äôs history was the Chicano Movement, a civil
rights and social movement that began in Denver in 1969 and promoted the well
being of Mexican Americans (Chicanos). From the 1940‚Äôs through the 1970‚Äôs,
several other movements were supported in Colorado and in 1967 Colorado was the
first state to loosen restrictions on abortion in cases of rape, incest or
threats to a woman‚Äôs mental or physical health.

Politics aside (and included), my family and I enjoyed our last 27 years in
Colorado, at 9000‚Äô on a steep acre and a third, with literally hundreds of Pine
trees and about 30 Aspen trees partially encircling our house. Fall was
absolutely perfect with the yellows and oranges. We had four or five tall (75‚Äô)
Blue Spruce trees on one side and many wildflowers, including gorgeous Columbine
in our ‚Äúyard‚Äù. We had a view of very tall (12,000-14,000‚Äô) mountains to the west
and the sunsets were nothing short of spectacular.

We moved to Arizona in 2004, about a year and a half after seven FEET of snow
fell in less than five days. I was on the roof, shoveling (some neighbor‚Äôs roofs
caved in), when I decided I didn‚Äôt need the ladder to get down. That was no
problem at all but for the fact that on landing, I got stuck. It took me a few
minutes to get unstuck and my 17 year old son a few minutes to create a path
over to me. After five days of shoveling a path to the driveway and from there
to the road, the snowplow left about an eight foot wall of compacted snow for us
to deal with. From that point to the nearest grocery store in Nederland, the
road was one lane for ten miles, with several turnouts for passing. Thank
goodness I had enough beer to last for that five days, and enough firewood,
food, and the electric service miraculously continued. Old age convinced my wife
and I to move, but we DO miss that beautiful place in the Colorado mountains. I
also miss the absolute thrill of skiing in those mountains. In my youth I would
say skiing is the next best thing to sex.

The final chorus to Rocky Mountain High by John Denver: ‚ÄúAnd the Colorado Rocky
Mountain High I‚Äôve seen it rainin‚Äô fire in the sky Though he‚Äôd be a poorer man
if he never saw eagles fly Rocky Mountain High‚Äù
