# ✏️ Corel Draw

CorelDraw is a Windows environment application for graphic design which uses
vectors to represent shapes instead of bitmaps. It was created in 1989 and has
been evolving through 21 versions to this day. The current version is CorelDraw
2019, and it includes a bitmap editing application, Corel Photopaint, a very
complete program to work with photos or any other bitmap image, as well as some
other apps. Corel 2019 was released, for the very first time, for Apple MacOS as
well as for Windows.

Vectors: digital images can be stored as grids of colored points (pixels) known
as bitmaps, so even the best quality picture, when you expand it or take a very
close look, will show these colored pixels and smooth lines will become saw
lines that look like stairs. Vectors do not use bitmaps, but mathematical
functions to represent shapes. A function can work with very small numbers or
very big numbers all the same and will always be precise, so you can look at a
vector image from a distance or very close and it will always look perfect, no
pixels, smooth lines all the time, and has the advantage of requiring far less
memory to be stored than bitmaps.

Another good point for vectors is that images can be translated into bitmaps
with as much quality as needed, while the inverse conversion is far less
efficient and will produce worse results. CorelDraw has become a very
professional tool for the graphic designer, including a huge variety of working
alternatives like basic shape drawing (lines, squares, circles and ovals,
polygons, stars, spirals, grids, curves), shape editing (weld, trim, intersect
shapes), text tool, text into curves conversion, node editing, interactive fills
(flat color fill, gradient fill, pattern fill, bitmap fill), translucent shadows
and glows, translucent shapes, and basic bitmap editing.

CorelDraw has the capability to manage bitmaps together with text and vectors to
produce complex compositions like magazine pages, so it's a great alternative
for publishing composition, multi-page files, bitmap tracing, effects like
perspective or shape distorting, and dozens of other tools.

The user interface of CorelDraw is very intuitive and friendly, and digitizing
tablets can be used with the program, allowing the designers to produce artistic
and lively images. To help users, there is a wide support net which includes
blogs, videos, tutorials and chat communities. These are some links:
