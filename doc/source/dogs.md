# üêï Dogs

‚ÄúDogs‚Äù is a complex subject because they are all different. Imagine that.
Really. The point is that each one must be treated according to his or her
personality and past experiences that shape their personality. This makes sense,
but many people fail to recognize that fact.

The idea is, that when you get a new dog, the best approach to training depends
on the personality of the dog, so the best starting point is for you and the dog
to get to know each other before serious training begins. In the first few days,
keep training to a logical minimum, potty training, discouragement of
destructive behaviors, etc. Keep the dog close to you and treat it with respect
(but don‚Äôt coddle it too much) so it knows you are someone it can trust. Observe
it closely and LEARN what its likes, fears and preferences are, THEN you can
adjust your training methods to yield the best results. This is especially
important when your dog is a rescue. You likely will not have more than a clue
as to the dog‚Äôs past experiences.

Since dogs are pack animals, you want the dog to see you as the leader of the
pack. In a pack, the leader is fair and he (or perhaps in your case, she) treats
the members of the pack in a fair way. So THINK about the signals the dog is
sending and how you can best communicate YOUR desires to the dog when training
begins. Do NOT punish a dog for breaking rules until you have told the dog what
the rules are. At first, discipline the dog gently and reward it randomly for
appropriate behavior. By that I mean that the dog should expect a reward but not
a specific reward. Treats are great, but don‚Äôt give the dog a treat every time
it comes when you call - sometimes a treat, other times just praise. That is
teaching the dog how real life works.

Give your dog something it can count on, but only in a general way. Dogs need
structure. Seeing YOU as the leader, a fair leader, will give it that structure.
If you pay attention, you‚Äôll see what is working and what is not. Positive
reinforcement is better than negative.

You WILL leave the dog alone occasionally. Don‚Äôt make a big deal out of it.
Leave the dog in a room, a crate or the house, but just leave. Let the dog know
it is not being punished and that wherever you leave it, it will be safe - no
big deal. Until you feel the dog can be trusted, a crate or a specific room is
just fine. Just don‚Äôt make it a big deal with all kinds of coddling or any other
emotional display.

I‚Äôm not a an expert, but I have learned what I learned about dogs through my own
experience (eight dogs over a period of many years) and also the from advice I
found on blackbeltdogtraining.com. It‚Äôs NOT what it sounds like. Robert Cabral
IS an expert and a very caring dog trainer. Go here:

New Dog‚Äù. It‚Äôs a great starting place for you and your new friend! There are
many other articles as well that can be very helpful. Enjoy!
