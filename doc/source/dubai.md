# Dubai

Ever wondered what would it be like to be standing on the highest manmade building in the whole world!

First, Dubai is one of the emirates of the United Arab Emirates, there is also Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras Al-Khaimah, Fujairah, and Om Quwain. It’s one of the Arab Gulf countries and one of the richest countries in the world.

Dubai - one of the most amazing places you'll ever visit on earth now unless you've been sleeping under a rock for the past ten years or so you've heard of Dubai the giant megacity that has risen from the deserts with some of the most or inspiring attractions that you'll ever visit on earth!

But let me tell you one thing…

Dubai is incredibly massive! it's about 30 miles from end to end and it keeps getting bigger every year, most likely you'll step off your plane at Dubai International airport one of the most lavish airports that you'll ever come across in your entire life!
Seriously!
the best way to get to your hotel from the airport is to use the metro system all the signs are in Arabic and English and they're pretty easy to figure out.

to travel you'll need a card which is a prepaid card that you can get from any ticket booth, it's that simple the metros themselves are brand new they're modern, efficient, always on time, clean, fast, and the best way of getting around the city of Dubai!

Dubai Filled with tall skyscrapers that are extremely luxurious residences that you can rent or buy filled with cool places and parties is 24/7 non-stop with hundreds of bars and clubs in the city, also restaurants shops. etc. and this place is pretty damn stunning during the day and the night but one of the cool things about Dubai is the beaches! yes, you can sunbathe and do everything else that you can do on a normal holiday right here in Dubai without fear of getting into trouble.
While roaming the city, you'll notice that Dubai in general pretty much has everything you could imagine! they even have a real Madrid bar for some reason.

If you’re bored for some reason from all the skyscrapers and entertainment places in Dubai and want to explore the authentic side of the city where you just want to be far from all these touristy stuff, you'll need to go to an area called Dara and this is at the north end of the city where you'll find stuff like middle eastern old buildings, ports, lots of old boats which is way closer to normal life in anywhere with the identity of Dubai.

There's a lot of historical things that you could see whilst you're here, and I highly recommend that you take a morning to at least explore all the buildings right next to Dara is Dubai Creek this is a creek that is inhabited on both sides now you can't cross the creek directly by foot so you either gonna have to take the metro or you're going to have to take one of the many incredibly authentic boats.
speaking of incredible let me tell you about the best attraction that's near Dara, the Dubai frame!
if you're thinking that it's a giant picture frame in the middle of a desert, you'd be right!
it is massive and as you can imagine the queues to get in it can be quite lengthy and you might be waiting a while when you get in it, spend some time walking around the perimeter because you just can't believe that this is a giant picture frame that is in the middle of the desert!

Bigger than the most famous building in all of Dubai, the Burj Khalifa;
the tallest building in the world!
they've got fountains very similar to what you might find at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and as you can imagine you have to get there pretty early because there's a whole crowd of people waiting for the show
it goes off every half an hour from about 6 o'clock so if you miss a show, you only have to wait about half an hour for another one to start and when it does start you get these magical musical fountains that do wonderful things to various Arabic or English music in the shadow of the biggest building in the world!
