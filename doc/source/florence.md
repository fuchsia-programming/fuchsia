## Baptistery of San Giovanni

The other treasure found in the Duomo square is the Battistero di San Giovanni, covered in green and white marble, where its three bronze doors stand out with immense artistic value, especially the Gate of Paradise that was made during 26 years by Lorenzo Ghiberti, made up of 10 panels with reliefs from the Old Testament, although you can only see a copy there, since the originals are kept in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (to keep them in optimal conditions).

## New Market

The Mercato Nuovo is an old market built at the end of the 16th century and is currently dedicated to the sale of leather goods, souvenirs and flowers, among other things. Among the curiosities you will see a boar sculpture made of bronze, where the tradition says that if you rub its nose it will bring you luck and the Stone of Scandal, which is a marble circle where defaulters were punished in the Middle Ages, also at an architectural level it is very interesting. But if you want to buy quality Italian products, the recommendation is to go to the Central Market.

## Della Signoria Square

Della Signoria Square is a vast open-air museum, where in medieval times it was the center of political and civil life in Florence. Surrounded by houses from the 13th century, it has several points of interest, starting with the Logia dei Langi, which has statues such as the Rapture of the Sabine Women or Perseus with the head of Medusa. Next to it you will find the impressive Fountain of Neptune, as well as the statue of Hercules and Cacus, as well as a copy of Michelangelo's David, because the original is in the Accademia Gallery.

## Palazzo Vecchio

The Palazzo Vecchio is also located in Piazza della Signoria and was the residence of the Medici family. On the outside it stands out for its 94 m tower and its robustness, giving it the appearance of a castle, however, the real gems are found inside in the Sala del Cinquecento, where you can see beautiful frescoes by Giorgio Vasari that decorate its ceilings and walls, in addition to the sculpture of Michelangelo the Genius of Victory.

## Church of Santa Croce

The beautiful Piazza Santa Croce is surrounded by grand palaces and the Church of Santa Croce. This temple is also called the Pantheon of Italian Glories, because it houses the tombs of such illustrious figures as Galileo Galilei, Michelangelo, Lorenzo Ghiberti, Machiavelli, an empty tomb in honor of Dante Alighieri and a statue of the latter artist.

## Uffizi Gallery

The Uffizi Gallery has one of the most important pictorial collections in the world. The palace that houses the gallery was the residence built by the Medici to move from the Palazzo Veccio, and is currently, together with the Vatican Museums, the busiest in Italy. This is because it contains works such as The Birth of Venus by Botticelli, Bacchus by Caravaggio, The Annunciation by Leonardo Da Vinci, The Holy Family by Michelangelo, the Virgin of the Goldfinch by Raphael and the Venus of Urbino by Titian, among others many others.

It is a stone bridge that has hanging houses and well-kept jewelry stores on both sides, with excellent views of the river from its central area and through it the famous Vasarian corridor crosses, which was a passageway used by the Medicis to move without having to go out into the street, from the Palazzo Vecchio to the Pitti Palace.

The Pitti Palace is a large building that houses important collections of paintings, sculptures and other valuables, especially within the Palatine Gallery that is located inside. After visiting the palace, we recommend you take a walk through the gardens and observe its highlights such as the Grotto di Buontalenti, the Grotta Grande, the Kaffeehaus, the Garden of the Knights and the Viottolone, which is full of cypresses and statues that will take you up to the Isolotto.

## Michelangelo Square

The Gallery of the Academy houses the original work of David by Michelangelo and other unfinished works by the artist such as the 4 prisoners.

## Medici Chapel

In the Medici Chapel are the tombs of the most powerful family in Florence for many years. A large part of the members rest in the Chapel of the Princes built with marble and semi-precious stone. On the other hand, the New Sacristy was designed by Miguel Angel but he was unable to complete it, even so it is worth seeing different sculptures made by this great master.
