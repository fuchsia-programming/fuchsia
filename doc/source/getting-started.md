# ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started

This set of documentation is written in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) which is a
lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing.

Markdown takes about 10 minutes to learn and GitHub provides its three-minute
read on
[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Discussion about code base improvements happens in GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/slurpcode/slurp/issues) and on
[pull requests](https://github.com/slurpcode/slurp/pulls).
