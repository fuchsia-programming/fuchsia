# ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started

Stay here if you want a basic intro to the world of GitHub.
If you just want to work on the `doc` folder or our documentation site
<https://slurp.readthedocs.io/> then skip to [Documentation](#documentation)

## Introduction

This set of documentation is written in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) which is a
lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing.

Markdown takes about 10 minutes to learn and GitHub provides its three-minute
read on
[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Discussion about code base improvements happens in GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/slurpcode/slurp/issues) and on
[pull requests](https://github.com/slurpcode/slurp/pulls).

## Hosting

- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - no longer free
- [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/)
- [Render](https://render.com/)

## Basic Setup

The project requires Golang, Node, Ruby, Python and more.

From the root of the repository:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Documentation

Python [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) based `slurp documentation`
site written mainly in Markdown. We have a local requirements file just for
the `Read the Docs` hosting in the `doc` folder

```shell
cd doc || exit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Files are stored in `doc/source`. From the `doc` folder you can build the
HTML output files which are stored in `doc/build`. These local build files
are ignored from Git.

```shell
cd doc || exit
make html
```

On Read the Docs we also have
[PDF](https://slurp.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/) and
[Epub](https://slurp.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/epub/) versions

## Fuchsia Programming Site

`Fuchsia Programming` is a Jekyll based site that requires Ruby which
is stored in the `docs` folder. Don't get mixed up with `doc` from the
[documentation](#documentation) site above.

```shell
cd docs || exit
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

For ease of use and for those that don't have Ruby installed we now have
a Dockerfile that runs the Fuchsia Programming site.

Run `$ docker build --tag slurp .` to build the image.
Then to run the container:

`$ docker run --publish 4000:4000 slurp`

Example output:

```
slurp % docker run --publish 4000:4000 slurp
