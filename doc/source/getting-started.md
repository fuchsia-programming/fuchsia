# ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started

This set of documentation is written in [Markdown](
https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) which is a
lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing.

Markdown takes about 10 minutes to learn and GitHub provides its
three minute read on [Mastering Markdown](
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Discussion about code base improvements happens in GitHub issues and on pull requests.
