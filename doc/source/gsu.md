of the university dates back to 1481. In 1481, Bayezid II found a school named
‚ÄúGalata Sarayƒ±‚Äù which means ‚Äúthe Palace of the Galata‚Äù. Galata is the name of a
neighborhood in Istanbul. That school was also like a university for Ottoman
Empire. The purpose of the school was to train officer for state administration.
In 1838, the building was reconstructed and started to serve as a medication
institute. Then in 1868, Galatasaray Mekteb-i Sultanisi was founded. That
school‚Äôs focus was to teach French and the freedom. In 1874, three academical
branches were established and their curriculum was designed in line with that of
Sorbonne. Then in 1924, with the decision of Great Atat√ºrk, the school became a
high school, and it still continues to educate young people. It is the hardest
high school to enter because you need to score 500 out of 500 in high school
entrance exams. ![image3](_static/images/gsu/image3.jpeg) In 1992, President
