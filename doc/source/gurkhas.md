# Gurkhas or Gorkhas

The Gurkhas or Gorkhas , with endonym Gorkhali , are soldiers native to South
Asia of Nepalese nationality recruited for the British Army, Nepalese Army,
Indian Army, Gurkha Contingent Singapore, Gurkha Reserve Unit Brunei, UN
peacekeeping forces and in war zones around the world. Historically, the terms
"Gurkha" and "Gorkhali" were synonymous with "Nepali", which originates from the
hill principality Gorkha Kingdom, from which the Kingdom of Nepal expanded under
Prithivi Narayan Shah.

Gurkhas are closely associated with the khukuri, a forward-curving Nepali knife,
and have a reputation for military prowess. Former Indian Army Chief of Staff
Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw once stated that:

> "If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or he is a
> Gurkha."

## Background

During the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–1816) between the Gorkha Kingdom
(present-day Nepal) and the East India Company, the Gorkhali soldiers impressed
the British, who called them Gurkhas.

## Queen's Truncheon

The Queen's Truncheon is a ceremonial staff carried by the Royal Gurkha Rifles
that serves as the equivalent of and is carried as the Colour. It is made of
bronze and silver. The top represents the minaret of Delhi Palace with three
Gurkhas standing on it supporting the Queen's crown above their heads. The
minaret contains a pair of crossed kukris and carries the inscription "Main
Picqet Hindoo Rao's House, Delhi 1857". The Truncheon is a unique emblem upon
which recruits swear allegiance to the Regiment and the Crown.

## Quotes About Gurkhas

> 'Their soldiers are stout, thick, well built men, in general; very active and
> strong for their size. They understand the use of the tulwar or sabre, and
> prefer close fighting, giving an onset with a loud shout: each man wears,
> besides his sword, a crooked, long, heavy knife, called “cookree” [kukri],
> which may be used in war, but is also of the greatest use in all common
> operations, when a knife or a hatchet is needed.' **James Baillie Fraser,
