<br>Niemann started with two draws and ended with two draws, and won three
games in the middle. In a clash of upcoming generation players, he with
a good technique outplayed Indian star GM Arjun Erigaisi in an endgame.
This win was the real separator between winner and runner up.

<br>Upcoming task for Niemann is the Bundesliga, the Sharjah Masters, the
Prague Masters, after that a tournament in Armenia, and again the
Bundesliga. In one of the previous year he played whooping 259 classical
rated games and this year he expects to play 150, which he considers
less than what he wants to actually play.

<br>It seems obvious that his first goal would be to cross 2700, but Niemann
didn\'t want to reveal anything regarding his future ambitions when
interviewed by GM Erwin l\'Ami he said \"Let\'s just say I will be
continuing to work very hard and try to improve.\"

<br>After winning the tournament Niemann said \"If you\'re organizing any
strong tournaments, please invite me. I would like to play nonstop!\"
which clearly says it all about his ambitions to cross 2700.
