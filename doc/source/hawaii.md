Hawaii is a state (number 50) of the United States, with Honolulu being its capital located on the island of Oahu and its most populous city. Although it is true that Hawaii belongs to the United States, they are not even on the same continent since this archipelago belongs to Polynesia, which is part of Oceania, however, it is closer to America than to Australia, which is the territory closest to Hawaii of the main landmass of Oceania.
The Hawaiian archipelago is made up of eight main islands, the largest being Hawaii or also called the Big Island, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Kauai, Lanai, Niihau and Kahoolawe.
The state of Hawaii offers you beautiful white sand beaches and a wide range of cultural and tourist attractions. On Oahu you can view World War II ships or swim in the famous white shores of Waikiki Beach. On the Big Island you will find green sand beaches, even black.

## Hawaii Volcanoes National Park

On the Big Island is Hawaii Volcanoes National Park where you can see the Klauea volcano, which is one of the most active in the world, as well as Mauna Loa, which is the largest volcano on the planet.
