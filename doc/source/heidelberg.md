## Altstadt or Old Town

Altstadt is the oldest site in the city and is located below the castle. A succession of narrow streets stretches along the river and there you will find baroque buildings, restaurants, shops and the most famous attractions of the city. Altstadt was practically destroyed in the 1690s by French troops and was rebuilt during the 18th century. Unlike most German cities, however, it was almost undamaged in World War II, as it became the American seat of military command. Marktplatz or the Market Square is the meeting point since the Middle Ages, so there is always activity, as well as being a market that still survives on Wednesday and Saturday mornings, where you can find fresh produce, fish, flowers, etc.
