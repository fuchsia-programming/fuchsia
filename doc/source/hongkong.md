# Hong Kong

Hong Kong is located on the southern coast of The Peoples Republic of China. The former British colony consists of three main areas; The New Territories, The Kowloon Peninsula, and Hong Kong Island.

Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places on the planet. It's dramatic cityscape cling to the hillsides and the edges of its spectacular harbor.

Hong Kong is the embodiment of yin and yang, the Chinese concept of balance. It is filled with neighborhoods that resonate with Chinese and colonial tradition, while its soaring skylines look boldly towards the future.

For visitors, Hong Kong offers some of the world's most intense shopping, sightseeing and dining experiences, yet moments of stillness await at every turn. Faith is an integral part of local life. Everywhere you go you'll smell the scent of incense wafting from shrines.

Hong Kong has over 600 places of worship, from small neighborhood temples, to hilltop complexes like the Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery. In Hong Kong, shopping is almost a religion too! From malls like Pacific Place to the bustling markets of Temple Street and Ladies Street, tax-free Hong Kong is heaven bargain hunters.

The promenade is home to some of the territory’s premier arts institutions, like the Museum of Art and the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. From the promenade, hop aboard an historic Star Ferry for the short crossing to Hong Kong Island.

Explore the malls and futuristic architecture of Hong Kong's main business district, Central.Then take tram to the island's highest mountain, Victoria Peak.

At the Peak Tower, meet some of the giants of history, politics, and popular culture at Madam Tussauds.
Then head up to the observation deck for the best views in Hong Kong. Looking down upon the skyscrapers and apartment towers, you might wonder how so many people can live in such a tightly packed area.

Yet Hong Kong offers plenty of green spaces too. Take a stroll around Lugard Road to experience the Peak's dense woodlands. While closer to earth, Hong Kong's urban centers feature pockets of peace everywhere.

There are the wide-open spaces of Victoria Garden, the hillside tranquility of Hong Kong Garden, and the birdsong of the Po Lin Street Bird Garden.

Kowloon's Walled City Park is a gateway into the world of classic Qing Dynasty design, and features statues of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac. Outside the urban areas, visitors are often surprised to learn that over forty percent of the Hong Kong's territory has been designated as national parkThanks to Hong Kong's excellent public transport system, quiet beaches, lightly populated islands and wild places are never more than short ride away.

Heading to Lamma Island and spend the day swimming, exploring villages, and hiking its many trails. Lantau is the largest of Hong Kong's 250 Islands.

Take the 25-minute car ride to the mountain-top village of Ngong Ping. Here you'll find the Po Lin Monastery, and one of Hong Kong's biggest attractions, the Tian Tan Buddha. After paying your respects at the Big Buddha seek a little enlightenment along the Wisdom Path a trail dedicated to the centuries-old Buddhist scripture, the Heart Sutra. Down on Lantau's western coast, lose yourself in the narrow lane ways of Tai O.

This village has been home to fishing families for generations. The ramshackle stilt houses are a favorite with photographers, and its dried seafood is highly prized by cooks from all over Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, no matter how far you roam, you're never more than an hour from your hotel room, which is pretty cool I would say.

Gotta visit this awesome city soon!
