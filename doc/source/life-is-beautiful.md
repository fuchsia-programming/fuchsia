# üéûÔ∏è Life is Beautiful

This is a 1997 Italian film that was starred, written and directed by the filmmaker Roberto Benigni. The story of this film is drawn from real life about the experience of Rubino Romero salmoni, who was one of the Jews who was able to survive the holocaust and left the testimony of his experience through a book called "In the end I defeated Hitler" .

Roberto Benigni is also inspired to make this film by the experience of his own father, since during World War II he spent two years in a prison camp during Nazi Germany.

The film also stars Nicoletta Braschi who is the wife of the director in real life and Giorgio Cantarini. Life is beautiful is a film that is presented to us from the perspective of both the protagonist and his family, the horrible experience and everything they have to go through in order to survive, it also teaches us how love can be above hate and terror.

The story is about a young Italian but of Jewish origin who meets Dora at her work and falls madly in love with her. However, this young woman is the fianc√©e of a local fascist bureaucrat whose name is Rodolfo.

Guido (Roberto Benigni) manages to snatch his fianc√©e from the Nazi leader as a romantic process begins with the girl of his dreams, all this occurs while the change of environment propitiated by the Nazi ideology that is becoming violent becomes more and more evident. and dangerous.

Six years later Guido and Dora are married and have a son named Giosu√© while World War II is taking place. But despite the Nazi invasion and the outbreak of war, they lead quite a satisfying life where they are truly happy.

The family is a victim of irrational hatred and war that are present on Guido's son's birthday, when both are arrested for the criminal act of their Jewish origin and are soon put on a train that goes directly to a field. of concentration. Although it is true that Dora is not Jewish, she also demands to get on the train to be able to stay next to her loved ones, but when they arrive at the concentration camp, both men and women are separated into different rooms.

From the beginning, the family must get used to the horror, since some of their acquaintances and friends are sent to the gas chambers, since they are not considered by the terror regime as useful labor.

Throughout the film Guido manages to hide from his son the terrible circumstance in which he finds himself and makes him believe that it is a hyper-realistic contest in which it is a matter of winning as many points as possible, since the first to achieve 1000 points wins. you will be able to take home a real armored tank. He even explains to Giosu√© that he should remain calm, without demanding to see his mother, asking for food or appealing to tears, since that way he will lose points without having a chance to win the game. Keeping a low profile and avoiding the gaze of the Nazis at all costs, hiding from the danger that threatens them is an important part that will help them earn extra points for their team and in this way Guido convinces his son to behave up to the task of events.

This is how Guido justifies with all this fantasy, the reality of the moment and explains to Giosu√© that the guards mistreat them because in reality what they want is to win the tank for themselves. On the other hand, due to the ever decreasing number of children (since they have been murdered in gas chambers) it is because they are hidden in order to gain points.

Guido manages to convince his son in this way so that he does not want to go home, telling him that they are up in the score with respect to the rest and that they only need a little more time to be able to return home, but with the tank as a prize. .

The days go by with all the horrors that the holocaust generated, until one fine day the Germans begin to withdraw before the allied troops arrive, who already have enough counterweight in the war. However, the Nazi soldiers do not want to leave without doing as much damage as possible and intend to kill every Jew found in the concentration camp.

Guido instructs his son to hide and not come out until everything calms down, since they are very close to winning the prize. Meanwhile, the protagonist goes in search of Dora so that they can all go together, but at that moment he is surprised and one of the guards shoots him. As soon as dawn breaks, Giosu√© comes out of his hiding place and realizes that the Germans have fled. It is when suddenly a tank appears and the boy believes that it is the prize that will take him home, but it is the Americans who are liberating the field. They pick up the boy along the way and Giosu√© manages to find his mother among the released prisoners, excitedly informing him that they have won.

Guido's love managed to triumph in the face of horror, but not before offering everything he had in his power to keep the love of his life safe and sound, as well as free from trauma and horror.
