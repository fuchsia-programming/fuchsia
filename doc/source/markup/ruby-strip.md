# üéûÔ∏è Ruby Strip

## Ruby white space strip command line application

This program uses
**[Ruby Power](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/success-stories/)** to
strip whitespace from files, and the accompanying documentation provided aims at
being an easy to follow tutorial on all things
**[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)**.

This program runs on the
[command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and accepts
a single
[parameter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)>), a
folder [path](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)>) name.

It checks this folder [recursively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
through all sub folders and files for leading and trailing
[whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character).

It removes all the excess leading and trailing whitespace and
[copies](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_(command)>) the folder contents to
this projects `output`
[directory](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)>).

So far it has been checked against these
[file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format):

- \*.c
- \*.xml
- \*.xsl
- \*.txt
- \*.php
- \*.html
- \*.py
- \*.css
- \*.rb

Simply run:

```
$ ruby ruby-strip.rb -h
Usage: ruby-strip.rb [options]

Specific options:
    -p, --path path                  Directory or path relative to this
                                     directory to check for excess whitespace.
        --delay N                    Delay N seconds before executing
    -t, --time [TIME]                Begin execution at given time

Common options:
    -h, --help                       Show this message
        --version                    Show version
```

This should copy the folder to the `output` directory.
