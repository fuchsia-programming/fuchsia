In 2019, Omar Al-Abdullah was a guest on one of the programs, and the presenter
of the program tried to make him fall into the trap of questions to find out if
he considered that the State of Qatar supported ‚Äúterrorism.‚Äù He asked him if he
would be allowed to sing in it if he agreed to the 13 conditions of the
blockading countries, to which Al-Abdullah replied by saying: Qatar is an Arab
country, and I do not know these conditions."

The announcer returned and asked him if he sang in Qatar after the crisis,
"because it supports terrorism," he replied, " I did not sing after what
happened, but not for this reason." Omar's answers were highly praised by the
Jordanians, who considered that Saudi Arabia was trying to exploit them in their
crisis with Qatar, through its media.
