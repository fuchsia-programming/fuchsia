# üéπ Optophonic Piano

The Optophonic Piano was a one-off electronic optical instrument created by the Russian Futurist painter
Vladimir Baranoff Rossin√© (Born in 1888 at Kherson , Ukraine ‚Äì Russia, died Paris, France 1944). Rossin√©
started working on his instrument c1916. The Optophonic Piano was used at exhibitions of his own paintings and
revolutionary artistic events in the new Soviet Union, Rossin√© later gave two concerts with his instrument
(with his wife Pauline Boukour), at the Meyerhold and Bolchoi theatres in 1924. Rossin√© was influenced by the
ideas of Alexander Scriabin who connected sound and colour with music to produce a aesthetic synthesis ‚Äì this
current formed an important, almost mystical theme within Russian electronic music; through the photo-audio
experiments of the 1930‚Äôs until the ANS Synthesiser (itself named after Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin- ANS)
in the 1940s.

"The Optophonic Piano projected revolving patterns onto a wall
or ceiling by directing a bright light through a series of revolving painted glass disks, filters, mirrors and lenses."

" The keyboard controlled the combination of the various filters and disks. The variations in opacity of the painted disk and filters were picked up by a photo-electric cell controlling the pitch of a single oscillator. The instrument produced a continuous varying tone which--accompanied by the rotating kaleidascopic projections--was used by Vladimir Rossin√© at exhibitions and public events."

‚ÄúImagine that every key of an organ‚Äôs keyboard immobilises in a specific position, or moves a determined element, more or less rapidly, in a group of transparent filters which a beam of white light pierces, and this will give you an idea of the instrument Baranoff-Rossin√© invented."
