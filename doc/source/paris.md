# Paris

We know, COVID-19 had us locked up in homes, so I’d like to take you in a virtual trip to Paris since it’s the main sites people are missing on visiting during these terrible times.

Paris is located in the northern part of France, on the river Seine, let’s start with the Eiffel Tower. North of the Eiffel Tower you will find Arc de Triomphe, and the famous shopping street Champs-Élysées.

Les Invalides, containing museums and monuments related to the history of France as well as Napoleon’s tomb is located east of the Eiffel Tower. The two most famous museums in Paris, the Louvre Museum and the Musée d'Orsay, are located close to each other, on opposite sides of the Seine.

If you go south of Place Georges Pompidou, you’ll find Île de la Cité, where the Notre-Dame Cathedral is located. South of Notre-Dame you will find the Luxembourg Gardens, Montparnasse, which offers an amazing view of the city,

Normally, you will arrive at one of the following airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport the city's main international airport, Orly airport, or Beauvais-Tillé and smaller Châlons Vatry airport which are mostly used for low-budget airlines.

There are seven major train stations in Paris, one of which is Gare du Nord, the hub for arrival in and departure from the city via local rail systems and Eurostar.

Paris has an Oceanic climate with cold winters and hot summers. Rain is frequent all year round. Although temperatures typically range between 37° and 50 °F or 3° and 10 °C, it can be snowy in the winter. Because Paris is located in northern Europe, the days get shorter in late October and November. Plan accordingly to enjoy your day trip or outdoor activities as much as possible. The weather in the spring is unpredictable, and Summers are humid, with possible thunderstorms during the day.

The best time to visit Paris is in the spring from April to June, or in the fall from October to early November. At these times of the year, the weather is mild, and the tourist crowds are relatively small. Early December, January, and February are the cheapest months to visit Paris. Probably, the least convenient time to visit Paris is August, when there are crowds everywhere. But don’t worry, since Paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, you’ll have a great time regardless of the season. And how can you figure out the best days and hours to see the attractions? Just check Google to see how crowded a specific location is.

Many travelers stay in Paris for three days and try to see the highlights of this beautiful city in this short period. While you can visit most major attractions in three days, if you don’t want to be in a hurry, we recommend staying at least one or two extra days.

Paris is generally a safe destination, but there are some neighborhoods to avoid, especially at night. And typical for all major cities around the world, beware of pickpockets, especially around major attractions.

A great way to discover Paris, is to join a walking tour, organized by professional guides who know a great deal about the city’s rich history. Some providers even offer free walking tours. However, at the end of the tour it is recommended to make a donation.

Paris offers “The Paris Pass”, which allows you to save money if you plan to visit several museums and other attractions and want to skip the line at some sites.

You can enjoy amazing views of Paris from one of the following places: Sacré-Cœur, Eiffel Tower, Montparnasse, Arc de Triomphe, Galeries Lafayette. Everyone knows the Eiffel Tower or the famous shopping avenue Champs-Élysées. But the city of lights is also full of interesting hidden gems.

Did you know that Paris has its own Statue of Liberty, looking exactly like the one in New York City? Except, it’s smaller. In fact, it is a quarter-scale replica of Liberty Enlightening the World, commonly known as the Statue of Liberty.

The one in Paris is located on Île aux Cygnes, and if you still want to see more Statues of Liberty in Paris, there are others, like the one in Musée d'Orsay and its copy at Jardin Luxembourg. Or the one at Musée des Arts et Métiers. Or if you just want to see the flame, there’s one known as Flame of Liberty Paris.

And did you know that there is a small secret apartment at the top of the Eiffel Tower? It was built by Gustaf Eiffel to entertain the science elite like Eiffel’s friend Thomas Edison, and some say also to make some Parisians jealous.You can see Eiffel’s cozy apartment if you take the tour to the top of the Eiffel tower.

Paris is famous for good food, sweet pastries, and interesting and unusual bars. You can visit Lavomatic, where you literally enter through the washing machine. Try Ice Kube Bar where you can order a cocktail from an ice bar in an iced glass.

You are going to have a blast once you actually visit the city!
