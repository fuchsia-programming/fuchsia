# üêç Python is a useful and versatile programming language

Although it is true that depending on the source there are between 700 and 9000
programming languages, currently the most used are only 50 of them, among which
is Python. This programming language is used to develop all kinds of
applications and since it is an interpreted language, it is not required to
compile it to execute the instructions that are written in Python, but through a
program called an interpreter, the instructions are executed directly by the
Python script. computer, that is, it is not necessary to convert it to machine
language.

<br>On the other hand, Python is very similar to human language and therefore very
easy to read and write. Another of its great advantages is that it is a
multiplatform language, so that it can be used in any of the different operating
systems and it is open source, which means that it is completely free. Thanks to
its wide possibilities and its simplicity, Python has been gaining more and more
followers in recent years.

<br>This programming language has a general purpose, so that its instructions,
procedures and data structures are designed to solve any type of problem. This
is why big technology companies such as Facebook, Google and Instagram build
parts of their technology packages with Python. However, this programming
language is also used to build any type of projects that are in between points
and basic programs.

With Python, endless fields get along well, not only because of its simplicity,
but also because of its great power when it comes to processing data. That is
why every day more companies request Python experts and this language has
resurfaced in the workplace. Let's name some of its main applications:

## Big data and data analysis:

Python has a large number of data processing
libraries and that is why it can both analyze and manage a large volume of
data in real time, so it can transform a large amount of data into useful
information, being especially advantageous in these two areas.

## Data mining:

Analyzing large databases to predict future trends is what
data mining does, where Python can be very beneficial when it comes to
organization, data cleaning and the use of machine learning algorithms,
greatly simplifying this type of analysis.

## Data science:

Previously scientists used Matlab when working with a
large number of data, but after the creation of numerical engines such as
"NumPy" or "Pandas", they make Python the programming language par
excellence for this type of tasks.

## Artificial intelligence:

Much of the advancement of artificial
intelligence is due precisely to this programming language, since Python has
the ability to carry out complex ideas in very few lines, together with the
large number of existing frameworks.

## Blockchain:

The Blockchain database known worldwide for being the one
that supports cryptocurrencies works quite well with Python, since this
language is characterized by its versatility, speed and security, being very
useful when forming block chains, in addition to allows developers to
generate a simple blockchain in just a few lines of code, thus making a very
complex process simple.

## Machine learning:

Machine learning, as well as robotics and artificial
intelligence, are capable of learning by themselves as they process data.
This is how they acquire increasingly important information when making the
right decisions and Python is very effective in this area, so that it has
become essential in data processing.

## Web development:

This programming language allows you to develop very
complex websites but with fewer lines of code, as well as being optimized
and lighter. For example, Django is part of the Python frameworks and has
now become one of the most popular, as it can be very useful when creating
secure and dynamic websites. On the other hand, Python is widely used to
obtain information from all kinds of websites, just like Instagram,
Pinterest or Netflix do.

## 3D graphics and games:

Another of the strengths of this programming
language is its enormous capacity when it comes to handling 3D graphics,
since they have a large number of existing tools and frameworks, with
Blender, PyGame or Arcade being some of the More popular. For example,
Battlefield 2, which is one of the best-known war action games, both the
animations, the graphics engine and its different functionalities, were made
using Python.

## Python includes an interactive mode

The Python interpreter has an interactive mode where instructions can be typed.
There you will be able to enter the instructions one by one and be able to see
the result of your evaluation immediately, so that you can test parts of the
code interactively, before adding it as part of the program. This of course is
very useful when it comes to finding possible errors, without having to wait for
the entire program to run to see if that small portion works or not.

<br>Another of its advantages is that the programs can be designed in a modular way
and only one of the modules can be reused in other projects, being very easy to
export or import. Also, being an open source language, anyone can create
extensions or make modifications to this language, have libraries, frameworks
and other tools that allow the language to adapt to needs over time. If there is
a community of users who are committed to the language, open source will always
live up to its full potential.

<br>The Python Software Foundation has a forum on its website, capable of linking to
various community groups and there you can find endless peers to receive
tutorials, advice or inspiration.
