# üëë Queen Rhapsody

One of those bands that can be easy to overlook. They‚Äôre the kind of band you
take for granted, because you can't remember a time when they weren't there - so
there‚Äôs often a lot that most people don‚Äôt know about them.

With that in mind, let‚Äôs rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll !

Shocking though it might be, Freddie Mercury wasn't the given name of Queen‚Äôs
frontman. He was actually born into a devout Zoroastrian family to parents from
India. His birth name?

Farrokh Bulsara.

He was actually born in Zanzibar but spent a good chunk of his childhood at a
private school in India, where he started going by Freddie.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always walk around like a Persian popinjay. And no one‚Äôs gonna stop me,
honey.‚Äù

However, he didn't actually change his last name until around the time that
Queen was founded. Luckily, his chosen moniker tends to roll off the tongue a
little easier than the one he was born with.

Although their name is one of the most famous in rock history, Queen wasn't
always called Queen.

In their pupal state, when the band consisted of Brian May, Roger Taylor and Tim
Staffell, it was actually known as Smile. In 1970, however, Staffell left the
group to join another band, the delightfully-named Humpy Bong, and Smile‚Äôs
remaining members took on one of their fans as lead singer, leading to a
name-change in the process.

That fan was one Farrokh Bulsara and their new name was ‚ÄòQueen‚Äô. Feeling the
pressure "Under Pressure" was the result of a winning combination of David
Bowie, hard drugs, and failure.

In July 1981, Bowie went into the studio to record backup vocals for a Queen
song called

"Cool Cat."

Unable to get that particular song to work and despondent at their lack of
success, Queen and Bowie fell into their back-up plan: drinking wine and doing
cocaine.

As the evening progressed, something that could generously be referred to as
‚Äòcreativity‚Äô began to take hold. Queen and Bowie started messing around with a
completely different song, written by Queen's drummer Roger Taylor and
tentatively titled "Feel Like."

In a burst of creative hedonism, the song metamorphosed into something amazing.
The bass line came together, the duet was improvised, and "Under Pressure" as we
know it was born.

A kind of science

Brian May might not necessarily be a household name, but you'd struggle to find
someone who isn't familiar with his work. As guitarist for Queen, he wrote
"Brighton Rock," "Fat Bottomed Girls," and "We Will Rock You." That would be
more than enough accomplishments for most people, but, as the years grew on, he
just kept on going.

May had dropped out of college back in the '70s to pursue a career in music.
Although that panned out a little more than alright, he nonetheless decided to
go back to school over 30 years later to wrap up his doctoral thesis in
astrophysics.

Since then, he‚Äôs worked with NASA on a number of projects and even has an
asteroid named after him.

Queen's bassist John Deacon has been a lot of things. On Queen‚Äôs first album,
for example, he was ‚ÄòDeacon John', because the other band members thought it
sounded more interesting. He‚Äôs also a trained electronics engineer, and without
him, Queen wouldn't sound the way they do.

Deacon was the creator of the legendary Deacy Amp, the sound system that gave
Queen their trademark orchestral tones.

It's a piece of equipment that enthusiasts and engineers spent years trying to
replicate, but with limited success.

It wasn't until 2008, when a group of engineers tore the original machine apart,
that they managed to find some semblance of an understanding of its inner
workings.

Even more impressively, Deacon created the original Deacy Amp out of pieces he
found in the trash.

Bohemian Rhapsody

With all of the glamour, fame and jet-setting hedonism that Queen enjoyed
throughout their career, it doesn‚Äôt seem like much of a surprise that the band‚Äôs
story has been turned into a movie.

But it's been a long road to getting a Queen movie made. The first shot at one
was announced in 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen attached to play Freddie Mercury.

Three years later, and with nothing filmed, Cohen left the project, citing a
number of reasons for exiting the film, the most crucial being creative
differences with the surviving band members.

Cohen had wanted to make a gritty, adult-oriented look at the life and death of
Freddie Mercury, while Brian May and Roger Taylor instead wanted a more
family-friendly vibe, with half the movie focused on how Queen had kept going
after Mercury's death.

From there, the project continued to hit further speed bumps, burning through
actors and directors before Rami Malek was eventually confirmed as the star and
Bryan Singer came in to direct.

After one last controversy, the firing of Singer and his replacement by Dexter
Fletcher, Bohemian Rhapsody finally secured a November 2018 release.
