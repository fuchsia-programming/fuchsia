# ðŸ“„ Eclipse cheat sheets (XML) to DITA with Ruby, XSL, Nokogiri

## From Java, XSLT 2.0 with Saxon to Ruby, XSLT 1.0 with the Nokogiri Ruby gem

Using
[Ruby](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579)
on this project allows use to harness the power of
[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) particularly the
[Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/) gem along with XSLT 1.0 / XPath 1.0 to
create the DITA XML files. Using Ruby eliminates the need to use Eclipse and
Apache Ant and can be run standalone from the command line as long as you have
Ruby installed.

The Ruby file: `ruby-cheatsheets-to-dita.rb` builds the output parent Ditamap
`map.ditamap` (output/map.ditamap) and the 4 sub DITA tasks in the `output/dita`
folder.

## DITA Background

[Darwin Information Typing Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture)
(DITA) is an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) data model for authoring
and using the [DITA Open Toolkit](http://www.dita-ot.org/) (DITA-OT) you can
publish those ideas.

The DITA standard is maintained by the [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/) DITA
Technical Committee.

## The Project

The Ruby code in `ruby-cheatsheets-to-dita.rb` has some
[XSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL) code embedded, as well as some
[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) markup in a interpolated
[string literal](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html)
syntax.

The
[Eclipse cheat sheets](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/enterprise-architecture/eclipse-cheat-sheets.html)
test data folder - `cheatsheets-xml-test-data` is best viewed inside Eclipse,
and is used as input when `ruby-cheatsheets-to-dita.rb` runs.

```
$ ruby ruby-cheatsheets-to-dita.rb -h
Usage: ruby-cheatsheets-to-dita.rb [options]

Specific options:
    -p, --path path                  Enter the directory or path relative to this
                                     directory to the cheatsheets XML test data:
        --delay N                    Delay N seconds before executing
    -t, --time [TIME]                Begin execution at given time

Common options:
    -h, --help                       Show this message
        --version                    Show version
```
