# ü¶ò Steve Irwin, an Australian Legend

He would have been 57 years old today, you might be most familiar with Irwin from his Crocodile Hunter television series which documented his very close and dangerous seeming encounters with animals including crocodiles which he co-hosted with his wife Terry from 1996 to 2004.

His shows and television specials were broadcast in over 100 countries and he became a global celebrity loved and sometimes lampooned for his liberal use of the word crikey.

In the eyes of critics his stunts sometimes went too far like the time he fed a crocodile while carrying his infant son in his arms. there was also a time he was investigated for filming too close to humpback whales and penguins possibly putting them at risk. he was never charged with any crime. antics a sight, his devotion to animals and conservation began long before the show ever existed.

His father Bob Irwin is a herpetologist who founded a zoo in Queensland, Australia where Steve grew up.

Steve would come to run the park now called Australia Zoo and promote the educational and conversation efforts there. ‚Äúmy job my mission the reason I've been put onto this planet is to save wildlife‚Äù he once said.

He had reason to worry, the average vertebrate birds, fish, mammals, amphibians, population‚Äô has declined 60% since 1970 according to the World Wildlife Fund. the future for biodiversity on planet Earth due to human activity looks and they weren't just words.

His wildlife warrior‚Äôs charity bought up hundreds of square miles around the world for wildlife conservation, the charity which is still operating today is also involved in conservation efforts for animals like Sumatran tigers, koalas, Cambodian elephants, and more.

The Australia Zoo even manages a 500 plus square mile reserve in the north of Queensland named after her win whether or not you approved of us has up close an aggressive approach to videotaping animals it's clear pop culture could use more science and wildlife celebrities

Like urban for too many. the enormous diversity of life on Earth as a remote abstraction something that belongs to another more fantastical world people like urban Jane Goodall and David Attenborough help us appreciate the natural world by bringing it into our homes and selling us on its importance and vulnerability with their care, Wonder, thoughtfulness, and, enthusiasm.
