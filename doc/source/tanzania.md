## Serengeti National Park

If you are a wildlife lover you should visit the Serengeti sometime. This park was established with the purpose of protecting the shocking phenomenon of the Great Migration and it is when each year more than 3 million herbivores travel up to 3000 km in search of more fertile land until they reach the Masai. Today it is the main source of tourism in the country and an impressive site to see animals in total freedom and this park extends through countless sheets, rivers and forests that are home to lions, leopards, rhinoceroses, cheetahs, hyenas , buffalo, zebra and other species.

Any day in the Seregueti begins at dawn, which is the time when the cats are most awake. Walking the paths of the park to see wildlife in first person is an experience without limits and then you can enjoy a beautiful sunset of all colors. Later you can rest in one of the camps, to start the next day with another marathon safari day. It is advisable that you plan at least 3 days to get to know its 14,763 kmÂ² area, but you will also have the opportunity to contemplate one of the most beautiful landscapes in all of Africa from the heights of a balloon, which is an experience that you should not miss.
