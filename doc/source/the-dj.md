# ðŸŽ¼ The DJ

"In a year before the turn of the millennium, a survey in Germany found that 70% of young people surveyed
would like to be a disc jockey." *

The question may arise as to what might be the reason for this. What does a DJ (disc jockey) actually do? What is
his/her role and what makes someone a good DJ? What is the future of DJing?

As incredible as it may be, DJing itself dates back to the wartime, when some wanted to entertain their comrades
in this way. Since then, a lot of time has passed, and the name itself has got a completely different meaning, but the
role has also changed a lot with the development of technology and needs.

What are the basic tasks of a DJ? Selection (compiling a musical program for a given set), technical skills
(mixing), presence (keeping in touch with the audience). *

The basic requirement for a DJ is to perform his set as smoothly as possible, for which it is essential to have a
good knowledge of the songs played and the playing device (mixer), as this allows him to mix two music tracks in
a completely unique way, thus achieving the effect of continuity and appropriate enhancement of mood.

"A disc jockey can be neither a slave nor a dictator." *

A DJ can really measure the success of his set from the reaction of the audience, as the goal is to entertain.
Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the needs and feedback of the audience (even in the form of body
language), but this should not be the sole goal, as the process may lose its meaning because a set can be really
successful if both the audience, and the DJ feel good during the process.

## The present and the future

It is interesting to note that in many cases today we cannot talk about spinning disks at all, as modern technology
allows us to take our music with us when stored on an external storage device (pendrive, external HDD), thus
protecting the music from amortization.

On the other hand, this is exactly what makes a DJ, who plays music from vinyl, special, but no matter how we
look at it, analog sound is a kind of ancient, instinctive world that makes it a curiosity forever.

Of course, in the meantime, transcoding systems have emerged (e.g. Serato), which is a kind of hybrid of the two
worlds, because one can play music from a vinyl(-like) plate using a digital signal.

Today, systems have been introduced that make it no longer necessary to have an external storage device, because
thanks to the latest developments, music can also be played directly from the cloud.
