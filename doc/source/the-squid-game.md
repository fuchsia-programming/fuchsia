To the surprise of the players who may die, they appeal to the third clause of the contract, where it is specified that everyone will be sent home if the majority of the participants vote in favor of ending the games, but yes, they will not receive money any. All the participants vote and it is the player 001 with the decisive vote of him, the one who places the balance in favor of everyone returning home safe and sound.

Gi-hun goes to the police to report the macabre games, but no one believes him for lack of evidence. However, a detective named Hwang Jun-ho whose brother has disappeared realizes that they both received the same card.

Subsequently, each of the players is invited again and due to the precarious economic position they accept 187 of the 201 who remained alive, including Gi-hun.

Detective Jun-ho closely follows Gi-hun and hides in the van that takes them back to the games, successfully infiltrating himself by disguising himself as one of the masked workers and realizing the location is on an island. remote. The participants upon arrival, begin to form alliances where Gi-hun, his childhood companion Sang-woo, the old player 001 and the Pakistani who saved the protagonist's life meet.

Neither game is revealed in advance and the second game is about taking off figures from a platform made of sugar, but without breaking them and in a set time. Not knowing what it is about, Gi-hun chooses the most complicated figure (an umbrella) but manages to complete the game, after discovering that it is easier to detach the figure if he licks it to melt it.

Deok-su is a strong and ruthless player who kills another participant to take away his food and this what it does is increase the prize money, so a revolt led by Deok-su rises to eliminate the rest of the competition and It is when the player 067 joins the team made up of Gi-hun, to protect herself from the alliance formed by Deok-su and his cruel team.

The third game is made up of groups of 10 players for each team that are on two elevated platforms and it is about pulling a rope to make the opposing team fall into a deadly abyss. Gi-hun's team wins the match with an idea from Sang-woo and a strategy from player number 001.

In the fourth game the players are instructed to pair up and they choose their best ally. To their surprise, the participants are horrified to learn that they will actually play against their chosen partner, the game is with marbles and whoever gets their partner's marbles in half an hour wins and survives. Gi-hun chooses the old man with memory loss who is player 001 and when he is about to lose, he takes advantage of his opponent's memory loss thinking that he would not notice, but at the last moment the old man reproaches him but he leaves all his marbles anyway and Gi-hun goes on to the next round.

In the fifth game, the participants have 16 minutes to cross a bridge made up of normal or tempered glass panels. The tempered ones can support the weight of two people, but the normal ones break when standing on them. Afraid to step on the normal glass panes, many delay or refuse to move forward, but because they have a set time, the last few players are at a disadvantage as they can't make it to the other side just in time.

Sang-Woo pushes Player 017 to the next panel for taking too long and the glass shatters, revealing the safe panel. Only the last three players who are Sang-Woo, Player 067 and Gi-hun manage to cross the bridge.

Sang-woo kills the player 067 so that only he and the protagonist remain for the last game, which is called the "Squid Game". After a fierce fight in the rain Gi-hun defeats Sang-woo but refuses to kill him, he also tries to invoke the third clause so that they can both get out alive, but at that moment Sang-woo stabs himself in the neck taking off life, but as he dies he asks Gi-hun to help his mother with the prize money.
