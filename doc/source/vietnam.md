# üáªüá≥ The Vietnam War and Drugs, A deadly combination

The Vietnam War was a long, costly and divisive conflict that pitted the
communist government of North Vietnam against South Vietnam and its principal
ally, the United States.

The conflict was intensified by the ongoing Cold War between the United States
and the Soviet Union. More than 3 million people (including over 58,000
Americans) were killed in the Vietnam War, and more than half of the dead were
Vietnamese civilians.

the Vietnam War from 1955 to 1973, though it was now combined with rampant
non-sanctioned drug use.

Speed continued to be the approved drug of choice, but now soldiers gained
access to illicit drugs like heroin. Desperate soldiers would combine these two
powerful drugs to create their homemade injectable speedballs. This potent
combination creates a push-pull effect, both boosting energy and helping them
relax.

The high from these speedballs were stronger and more long-lasting than the high
they could get from using either drug on its own, and it helped the soldiers to
deal with the brutal conditions of war, as well as cope with the horrible
atrocities that they witnessed ‚Äì and even committed - during these wars.

Drug use during the Vietnam war reached epidemic levels - according to the
Pentagon, by the time the U.S. withdrew from the war in 1973, some 70 percent of
all-American soldiers in Vietnam had taken drugs. Shockingly, the authorized use
of drugs by soldiers in combat continues around the world to this day.

The research was conducted on the history of drug use pre-post and during the
Vietnam War found that overall there was heavy use of drugs from the majority of
soldiers, some cases found the government would give the soldiers drugs to help
them cope with the anxiety and stress caused by the war.

The soldiers were self-medicating with the main choice being heroin the
availability of the drug was staggering according to one veteran you could just
buy it by the roadside.

There was every kind of drug and alcohol for sale, American beer, and hard
alcohol but also cannabis, pills of every kind, and harder drugs. in several
provinces, you could buy pure liquid opium in a large vial for about ten
dollars!

The soldiers used to dip cigarettes and joints in the opium, a large vial was
more than you could use in a month even if you had a serious habit which I
eventually did ‚Äúsaid one soldier‚Äù, there was an incredibly high number of drugs
in Vietnam because there was a local demand for the drugs and also a new large
international soldier demand.

The soldiers would pick up when they went into larger cities and towns and then
bring it back with them to the remote outposts deep in the jungles of Vietnam.

They found that ninety percent of people who left for combat with traces of
drugs in their system reported heavy drug use while in Vietnam. forty-five
percent of people who were negative for drug use before departing also reported
heavy drug use while in Vietnam.

The easy access ability led to massive numbers of soldiers who were addicted as
heroin is the most addictive drug on the market. long term use of heroin can
lead users to develop a tolerance to the drug they need larger and larger doses
to feel the same effects and end up addicted. almost half of all soldiers tried
heroin while in Vietnam surprisingly the soldiers were able to recover from the
addictions fairly quickly once they returned home.

Turns out the only 5% of soldiers continued their addiction once they returned
home, the reason this is because they were using heroin to get away from the
reality of life for the American soldier in Vietnam.

A soldier says ‚ÄúI went to Vietnam in September of 1969 and during the time that
I was there, I went through certain experiences that led me into using drugs.
One of the experiences as I recall is during a night ambush, I killed a
12-year-old kid, you know it was something that I couldn‚Äôt handle at that time,
you know. Seeing him dead lying in the ground the next morning. It stayed on my
mind so, I started using drugs and I kept that up until I came back to the
states.‚Äù
