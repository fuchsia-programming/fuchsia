# üéñÔ∏è Wasfi Al-Tal

The twenty-eighth of November of each year is a painful memory in the hearts of
Jordanians of the loss of the master of men, the former Prime Minister, the
martyr Wasfi Al-Tal, whose name has always been associated in the hearts of
Jordanians with sincerity, dedication and the achievement of civilizational
achievements that are respected and appreciated by all Jordanians without
exception.

We remember the late Wasfi al-Tal, who had the white hands in accomplishing
dozens of civilized projects. In his first government in 1962, the establishment
of the University of Jordan came as the first scientific edifice in Jordan,
followed by the King Talal Dam project, which resulted in the reclamation of
thousands of acres in the central Jordan Valley, which was later formed Jordan‚Äôs
food basket, and one of the tributaries supporting the Jordanian economy in the
field of exporting vegetables and fruits to neighboring countries, as well as
the eastern Ghor Canal project, which took over the transfer of the waters of
the Jordan River and Yarmouk River for drinking purposes to the residents of the
central region through the Zay water station, as well as irrigating agricultural
projects in the northern Jordan Valley.

One of the vital projects that took place during the era of Wasfi al-Tal‚Äôs first
government was the establishment of the desert highway, which formed the main
nerve connecting northern and central Jordan with the governorates of the south,
passing through the governorates of Karak, Tafileh, and Ma‚Äôan, all the way to
the city of Aqaba, where this road contributed to an increase in the volume of
Jordan‚Äôs exports of phosphate and the increase in the volume of Jordan‚Äôs imports
Through the port of Aqaba to the local Jordanian markets, in addition to the
reclamation of agricultural lands in many areas of the central Jordanian desert,
especially in the Al-Dhalil area, where Al-Tal was the first to initiate the
reclamation of lands in the mentioned area for agricultural purposes.

Wasfi al-Tal also had the honor of initiating the establishment of the Phosphate
Company and the Potash Company to exploit the vast wealth of the Dead Sea and
expand the Jordanian coast on the Gulf of Aqaba to a distance of 100 km to the
south.

In Wasfi al-Tal‚Äôs second government, the Jordanian television and satellite
station were established, which became Jordan‚Äôs point of contact with the
outside world, the Jordan University Hospital, and the development of Al-Bashir
Hospital to be the most important medical edifice in the capital, Amman.

And when we recall Wasfi al-Tal, we remember his devotion to the Palestinian
cause, as he rushed in his early youth as a fighter in the ranks of the
Palestinian Salvation Army led by the leader Fawzi al-Qawuqji, after which he
moved as an officer in the ranks of the Syrian army to rise to the rank of
lieutenant colonel as a combat officer and then returned to Palestine, which he
loved to work with the Palestinian businessman Musa al-Alami to establish The
largest agricultural project in Jericho Governorate, which is still generating
good for its neighbors and works in it.

He also decided to establish Al-Ra‚Äôi newspaper to be a spokesperson for the
Jordanian state, and also decided to establish the National Union Party to be a
motive for political and partisan life in the country, and I also experienced
many humanitarian situations for that man who devoted a day from Every week to
receive citizens in the presidential house, offering help and assistance to
those who seek it from among the sons of the country, without discrimination or
favoritism to anyone.

On a summer day, a delegation from the people of Al-Hussein camp came to him at
the presidential house, complaining about the lack of water in their homes. He
immediately contacted the Director of Civil Defense, asking him to drive a water
tank himself into the camp to encourage the rest of his colleagues to accomplish
the task of delivering water to the camp‚Äôs homes through tanks in the camp. Over
three hours.

One day, he recalled the occurrence of a crisis represented by the lack of sugar
in shops all over the country, where the Minister of National Economy at the
time came to him complaining about the refusal of the sugar agent in Jordan to
provide sugar to the citizens. The late Wasfi contacted the agent and informed
him of the need to provide a verbal warning. Sugar in three hours as it was
provided in all shops urgently.

Among the well-known positions of Wasfi Al-Tal is his frequent visits to all
cities, villages, and camps in the Kingdom, where he would visit every week a
Jordanian city and several villages to see the conditions of citizens and work
to solve the problems they face on the ground without referring to the so-called
work committees.

Among his achievements, may God have mercy on him, is that he instructed the
cancellation of the security records of many politicians and partisans, and
ordered the transfer of their files to the ‚ÄúHouse of Fire‚Äù in the cement factory
in Fuheis, and allowed the return of many politicians who had sought refuge with
Jordanian pain to Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, and returned them to Jordan, and
appointed a number of them in Leadership positions, and I mention among them
Nazir Rashid, Ali Abu Nawar, Ali Al-Hiyari, Abdullah Al-Rimawi, and many others.

Wasfi al-Tal was a liberal nationalist and participated in all seminars and
conferences held in many countries of the world in support of the Palestinian
cause, and he always used to say that the best way to fight the Israeli enemy is
popular resistance because of what Israel obtained from advanced weapons and
military equipment from Western countries that exceeded them. In its size and
influence, all Arab countries combined.

Events have proven that the popular resistance is the most effective and most
successful means of combating the Israeli enemy, and this is what everyone saw
in the first and second Intifadas of stones in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which was confirmed recently, as the Islamic resistance achieved clear and clear
victories over the Israeli enemy, especially in the Gaza Strip.

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said when he was asked about the Arab
figure who was threatening the Israeli entity. Adoption of popular resistance
against Israel. Where he said: "Wasfi al-Tal was the most dangerous Arab figure
for Israel because he always called for the adoption of popular resistance
against Israel."

Wasfi Al-Tal was a pioneering Jordanian tale and today Wadha is an example of a
good biography that does not fade with time... Features of Wasfi‚Äôs biography He
exchanged the homeland and leadership in loyalty.
