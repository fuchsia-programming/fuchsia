# üè¢ Washington

Washington is the capital of the United States and unlike other capitals in the world, it is not exactly the largest city in the country, nor is it even one of the most touristic. This does not imply that there are few things to see in Washington DC, but the contrast is very strong when comparing this city with its neighbor New York, since it is much quieter and full of history.

Most of the monuments are located within the National Mall that runs from the Abraham Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol. Although it is true that the distance of this esplanade is only 4 km, it will take some time to get to know the large number of monuments, interesting museums and gardens that you can visit.

In this article we will guide you through the most important sites in Washington. The most recommended route through the National Mall begins at the White House and the idea is to visit the emblematic sites of this area, in a clockwise direction.

## White House

The White House is without a doubt the most mythical place to visit in Washington, it is filled with euphoric tourists as if they were about to meet the President, when the reality is that the building can only be seen from far away. They're putting up more and more security fences and increasing the number of armed secret service guys, it's not exactly a place where you feel comfortable, even the White House is a lot smaller than you see in the movies, maybe they show it from certain angles where they make it appear larger. In general, you will find a demonstration in front of the building, either against wars or racism.
