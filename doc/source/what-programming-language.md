# üéá What Programming Language to choose as a beginner?

According to myself Pulkit Govrani, you should choose Python over any other
language if you are just starting to learn programming. Let me tell you the
reasons that why should you choose it.

Python was developed around 1980s as a language which can be more readable,
intuitive and easily. It has a pretty easy syntax (syntax means the way how a
programming language is written). Python does a lot of complex functions inside
it to make things easier for the user. It can be used in Machine Learning, Data
Science and Web development as well. So it can be termed as an allrounder
programming language. Let‚Äôs look at the below example for understanding why
Python is easier to learn.

This is how we can print ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù in C++ :

So I am pretty sure you must have made your mind till now that learning Python
is both easy and beneficial for you.
