# üèÉ Working Out (You know, with weights)

I‚Äôm certainly NOT an expert at working out, but I‚Äôve been doing it for about 24
years. It all started when I was working in my first casino job and after a year
or so I mentioned at work one day that I had developed a VERY sore shoulder, and
I could barely lift my right arm above a position parallel to the ground. It
seems that pulling 22 lb. Quarter fill bags off the cashier counter and just
letting them drop while holding on to them was pulling my shoulder just a tiny
bit out of socket each time. OUCH!

A young woman coworker said ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you try exercise?‚Äù, and I said ‚ÄúNO,
that‚Äôs what hurts!‚Äù I had just started daily walks about two months before that,
and my wife went out on a limb and bought me a couple of 10 lb. Dumbbells for
Fathers Day. I married a smart woman!

That‚Äôs how it started and now I‚Äôve been working out for all that time. I have
found out a few things.

Do NOT start throwing weights around. Those weights can cause a lot of strain on
connective tissue if one does not use proper form, kind of like when I pulled
the fill bags off the counter. Using proper form is essential. What that
generally means is moving in a controlled way, in a motion that does not put a
strain on those connective tissues from assuming unnatural positions, and moving
at a controlled rate of speed in order to avoid strain on those tissues at the
beginning and end of the move. One can increase strength and muscle mass by
increasing the number of reps and by increasing the weight, but don‚Äôt try to
toss them around (with the exception of some kettle ball moves, again, very
controlled). The greater the weight, the more important that form is.

I‚Äôve found stretches to be very helpful in order to keep flexible and of course
there are a number of aerobic moves without weights that are very useful. So
far, I have not found a way to injure myself with those, with one exception. I
was doing push-ups, fast, and at the top of a push-up my left shoulder came out
of socket. Man did that hurt when I came down!!! I guess the lesson is to BE
CAREFUL.

Now that I‚Äôm old (75), I don‚Äôt even think about running. I hurt my lower back
one day after about a half a block of running. A little light jogging seems to
be OK though.

I try to get in at least two work-outs a week and three is better. The hard part
is just starting the workout. When I was going to the gym before COVID-19, it
was just walking in the door. But I do it because the evidence that one will
live longer with a regular exercise routine is overwhelming, and I KNOW that I
will always feel better after my workout. Every single time....... And the
strangest thing of all is that I seem to hear better after a workout (I have
severe hearing loss). Who would have thought?
